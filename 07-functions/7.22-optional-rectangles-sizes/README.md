# 7.22 PRACTICE: Functions*: Rectangles sizes
Suppose a graphics program needs a function to indicate whether one rectangle is smaller than another rectangle. A rectangle is specified by its upper-left coordinate and bottom-right coordinate. If the first rectangle is (1, 1) and (2,3), and the second is (0,0) and (10,10), the function returns true.

Hints:

* Use copy-paste to ensure your parameters exactly match the arguments. You can use the same names for parameters as the arguments.

* Declare local variables r1Area and r2Area to make your comparison expression simpler.

* Use the abs() function in cstdlib (requires #include ).

* Take great care to check and recheck that your calculations involve the correct values.
