# 5.20 LAB: Varied amount of input data
Statistics are often calculated with varying amounts of input data.
Write a program that takes any number of non-negative integers as input,
and outputs the average and max.
A negative integer ends the input and is not included in the statistics.

Ex: When the input is:
```
15 20 0 5 -1
```

the output is:
```
10 20
```

You can assume that at least one non-negative integer is input.
