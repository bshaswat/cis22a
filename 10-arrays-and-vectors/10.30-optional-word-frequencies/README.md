# 10.30 LAB: Word frequencies
![Ignore] [![lab.10.24]][10.24]

Write a program that reads a list of words. Then, the program outputs those words and their frequencies. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of words that follow. Assume that the list will always contain less than 20 words.

Ex: If the input is:

```
5 hey hi Mark hi mark
```
the output is:

```
hey 1
hi 2
Mark 1
hi 2
mark 1
```
> Hint: Use two vectors, one vector for the strings and one vector for the frequencies.
