# 12.29 PRACTICE: Vectors*: Copying only negative values
A list of 6 integers is input into vector listInts. Complete the program to copy only the negative integers to a new vector listNegInts. Output the number of negative elements, and the negatives list. Ex: For input 5 -2 0 9 -66 -4, output is:
```
3
-2
-66
-4
```
Hints:
* When declaring listNegInts, don't specify a size. Instead, add elements using listNegInts.push_back(â€¦)
* Write a first for loop that copies only the negative integers to listNegInts, then write a second for loop that outputs.
* Your copying for loop should have an if statement that only copies the current listInts element if negative.
* The number of items in listNegInts can be determined using listNegInts.size(). No need to have a separate variable keeping track.
