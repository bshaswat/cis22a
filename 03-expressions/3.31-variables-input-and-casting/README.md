# 3.31 LAB: Warm up: Variables, input, and casting
(1) Prompt the user to input an integer, a double, a character, and a string, storing each into separate variables. Then, output those four values on a single line separated by a space. (2 pts)

Note: This zyLab outputs a newline after each user-input prompt. For convenience in the examples below, the user's input value is shown on the next line, but such values don't actually appear as output when the program runs.
```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
```
(2) Extend to also output in reverse. (1 pt)
```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
Howdy z 3.77 99
```
(3) Extend to cast the double to an integer, and output that integer. (2 pts)
```
Enter integer:
99
Enter double:
3.77
Enter character:
z
Enter string:
Howdy
99 3.77 z Howdy
Howdy z 3.77 99
3.77 cast to an integer is 3
