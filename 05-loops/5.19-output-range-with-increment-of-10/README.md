# 5.19 LAB: Output range with increment of 10
Write a program whose input is two integers,
and whose output is the first integer and subsequent
increments of `10` as long as the value is less than or equal to the second integer.

Ex: If the input is:
```
-15 30
```

the output is:
```
-15 -5 5 15 25
```

Ex: If the second integer is less than the first as in:
```
20 5
```
the output is:
```
Second integer can't be less than the first.
```

For coding simplicity, output a space after every integer, including the last.
