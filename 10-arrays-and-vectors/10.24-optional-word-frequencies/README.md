# 10.24 LAB: Word frequencies - functions
Write a program that reads a list of words.
Then, the program outputs those words and their frequencies.
The input begins with an integer indicating the number of words that follow.


## Input
```
5 hey hi Mark hi mark
```

## Output
```
hey 1
hi 2
Mark 1
hi 2
mark 1
```

## Prototype
```cpp
int GetFrequencyOfWord(const vector<string>& wordsList, const string& currWord);
```

## Note
This is a lab from a previous chapter that now requires the use of a function.
