# 3.22 LAB: Divide by x
Write a program using integers `userNum` and `x` as input, and output `userNum` divided by `x` three times.

Ex: If the input is:

```
2000 2
```
the output is:

```
1000 500 250
```
_Note:_ In C++, integer division discards fractions. Ex: `6 / 4` is `1` (the `0.5` is discarded).
