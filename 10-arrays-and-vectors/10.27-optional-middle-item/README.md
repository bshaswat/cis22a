Given a sorted list of integers, output the middle integer. Assume the number of integers is always odd.

Ex: If the input is:

```
2 3 4 8 11 -1
```
(a negative indicates the end), the output is:

```
4
```
The maximum number of inputs for any test case should not exceed 9. If exceeded, output `Too many inputs`.

> Hint: First read the data into a vector. Then, based on the number of items, find the middle item.
