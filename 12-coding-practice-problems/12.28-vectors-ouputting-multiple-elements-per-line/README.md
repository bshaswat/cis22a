12 values have been input into vector yearlyValues. Output all 12 elements, with 4 per line. If the elements are 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120, the output is:

```
10 20 30 40
50 60 70 80
90 100 110 120
```
Hints:
* Use a for loop with increment i += 4, rather than ++i.
* Inside the for loop, just print all four elements using four cout statements. An inner loop could be used, but isn't necessary.
