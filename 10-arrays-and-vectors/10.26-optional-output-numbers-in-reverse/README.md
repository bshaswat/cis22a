# 10.26 LAB: Output numbers in reverse
Write a program that reads a list of integers, and outputs those integers in reverse. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of integers that follow. For coding simplicity, follow each output integer by a space, including the last one.

Ex: If the input is:

```
5 2 4 6 8 10
```
the output is:

```
10 8 6 4 2
```
To achieve the above, first read the integers into a vector. Then output the vector in reverse.
