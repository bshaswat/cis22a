# 4.31 PRACTICE: Branches**: Complex cost structure
An airline describes airfare as follows. A normal ticket's base cost is $300. Persons aged 60 or over have a base cost of $290. Children 2 or under have $0 base cost. A carry-on bag costs $10. A first checked bag is free, second is $25, and each additional is $50. Given inputs of age, carry-on (0 or 1), and checked bags (0 or greater), compute the total airfare.

Hints:

First use an if-else statements to assign airFare with the base cost.

Use another if statement to update airFare for a carryOn.

Finally, use another if-else statement to update airFare for checked bags.

Think carefully about what expression correctly calculates checked bag cost when bags are 3 or more.
