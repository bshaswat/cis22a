# 3.29 LAB: Input: Mad Lib
Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words, which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

Complete the program to read the needed values from input, that the existing output statement(s) can use to output a short story.

Ex: If the input is:
```
Eric Chipotle 12 cars
```
the output is:
```
Eric went to Chipotle to buy 12 different types of cars.
```
