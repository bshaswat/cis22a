# 10.24 LAB: Word frequencies - functions
Write a program that reads a list of words. Then, the program outputs those words and their frequencies. The input begins with an integer indicating the number of words that follow.

Ex: If the input is:

```
5 hey hi Mark hi mark
```
the output is:

```
hey 1
hi 2
Mark 1
hi 2
mark 1
```
> Hint: Use two vectors, one for the strings, another for the frequencies.

Your program must define and use the following function:
`int GetFrequencyOfWord(vector<string> wordsList, string currWord)`

> Note: This is a lab from a previous chapter that now requires the use of a function.
