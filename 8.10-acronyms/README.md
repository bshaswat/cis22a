An acronym is a word formed from the initial letters of words in a set phrase. Write a program whose input is a phrase and whose output is an acronym of the input. If a word begins with a lower case letter, don't include that letter in the acronym. Assume there will be at least one upper case letter in the input.

Ex: If the input is:

```
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
```
the output should is:

```
IEEE
```
Your program must define and call a function thats returns the acronym created for the given userPhrase.
`string CreateAcronym(string userPhrase)`

Hint: Refer to the ascii table to make sure a letter is upper case.
