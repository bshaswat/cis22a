# 2.9 LAB: Warm up: Basic output with variables
A variable like `userNum` can store a value like an integer.
Extend the given program as indicated.

1. Output the user's input. (2 pts)
2. Output the input squared and cubed. Hint: Compute squared as `userNum * userNum`. (2 pts)
3. Get a second user input into userNum2, and output the sum and product. (1 pt)

_Note: This zyLab outputs a newline after each user-input prompt. For convenience in the examples below, the user's input value is shown on the next line, but such values don't actually appear as output when the program runs._
```
Enter integer:
4
You entered: 4
4 squared is 16
And 4 cubed is 64!!
Enter another integer:
5
4 + 5 is 9
4 * 5 is 20
