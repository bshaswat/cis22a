# 7.26 LAB: Remove spaces - functions
Write a program that removes all spaces from the given input.

Ex: If the input is:
```
Hello my name is John.
```
the output is:
```
HellomynameisJohn.
```
Your program must define and call the following function. The function should return a string representing the input string without spaces.
`string RemoveSpaces(string userString)`

Note: This is a lab from a previous chapter that now requires the use of a function.
