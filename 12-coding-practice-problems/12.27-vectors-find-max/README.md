# 12.27 PRACTICE: Vectors*: Find max
Traversing a vector to find the max (or min) is common.
Given a vector of integers, output the maximum integer found in the vector.
If the input is `4 3 8 2 6`, the output is `8`.

## Hints
* Declare a variable named `maxItem` to hold the max value seen so far.
Update that value if you ever see a larger value.
* Initialize that variable to any element's value, NOT to `0`.
