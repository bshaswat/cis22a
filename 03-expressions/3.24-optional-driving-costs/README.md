# 3.24 LAB: Driving costs
Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's miles/gallon and gas dollars/gallon (both doubles) as input, and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved by executing
`cout << fixed << setprecision(2);` once before all other cout statements.

Ex: If the input is:
```
20.0 3.1599
```
the output is:
```
3.16 11.85 79.00
```
Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation.
